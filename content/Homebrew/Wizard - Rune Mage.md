**Rune Magic**
Commencing at 2nd level, your mastery over runes imbues your spellcasting with ancient power. When you cast a spell of 1st level or higher, you have the option to infuse it with the essence of runes. You may add a somatic component to the spell, or if it already possesses one, you can replace it with a rune, transforming the spell into a manifestation of runic magic.

**Rune Savant**
Starting at 2nd level, whenever you cast a spell that you have inscribed with a rune, you gain the following benefits:

- Your spell save DC or spell attack bonus for that spell increases by 1.
- The damage dealt by the spell is reduced by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

**Rune Energy** 
Beginning at 6th level, your mastery of rune magic allows you to harness the residual energy from your rune-inscribed spells. When you cast a spell that you have inscribed with a rune, you gain a rune charge. You can store a maximum number of rune charges equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your proficiency bonus (minimum of 1).

As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one or more rune charges to activate one of the following effects:

- **Empower Rune:** Spend 1 rune charge to empower your next rune-inscribed spell. When you cast the empowered spell, you can reroll any damage dice that result in a 1, taking the new result.

- **Shielding Rune:** Spend 2 rune charges to create a protective barrier of arcane energy around yourself or a creature you can see within 30 feet. The target gains temporary hit points equal to your wizard level plus your Intelligence modifier.

- **Swift Rune:** Spend 1 rune charge to enhance your agility and speed. Until the start of your next turn, your movement speed increases by 10 feet and you gain advantage on Dexterity saving throws.

- **Rune of Precision:** Spend 1 rune charge to enhance your accuracy. The next attack roll you make before the end of your turn gains advantage.

- **Rune of Resistance:** Spend 2 rune charges to grant resistance to a damage type of your choice to yourself or a creature you can see within 30 feet. This resistance lasts for 1 minute.

- **Rune of Vigor:** Spend 1 rune charge to restore vitality. You or a creature you touch regain hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your wizard level.

- **Rune of Disruption:** Spend 2 rune charges to disrupt the magic of a creature you can see within 60 feet. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be unable to cast spells or use magical abilities until the end of its next turn.

- **Rune of Reflection:** Spend 2 rune charges to create a shimmering barrier around yourself or a creature you can see within 30 feet. The next time the target is targeted by a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, the spell is reflected back at the caster if the attack misses.

**Mind's Eye** 
Starting at 10th level, your deep understanding of magic allows you to perceive its subtle intricacies with unparalleled clarity. You gain advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to cast spells that affect magic, such as Counterspell, Dispel Magic, and Detect Magic.

**Advanced Mind**
At the 14th level, your attunement to the ancient runes has elevated your mental prowess to extraordinary heights. You gain advantage on all saving throws against spells, drawing upon the protective energies of your runic symbology.

Moreover, should you harness the maximum potential of your rune charges, you can unleash a potent surge of magical power. By expending all your accumulated rune charges, you can empower your spells to inflict maximum damage for a duration determined by rolling a 1d4. This enhancement channels the concentrated might of your runic mastery, allowing you to wield formidable arcane might in battle.
