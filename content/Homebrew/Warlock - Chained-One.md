**Expanded Spell List - The Chained-One**  
The Patron that grants you warlock powers is an ancient, enigmatic entity bound by unbreakable chains. This being has gifted you access to a variety of spells that evoke the theme of constraint and domination.

The following spells are added to the Warlock spell list for you:

| Warlock Level | Spells                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1st           | Armor of Agathys, Grip of Hadar |
| 2nd           | Misty Step, Hold Person         |
| 3rd           | Glyphs of Warding, Bestow Curse |
| 4th           | Watery Sphere, Dimension Door   |
| 5th           | Dominate Person, Geas           |
**Restrained**  
Starting at 1st level, you gain proficiency with chains as a melee weapon. Your familiarity with these bindings allows you to wield them with precision and use them to restrain your foes.

As a bonus action, after you hit a creature with an attack using a chain, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature becomes restrained until the end of your next turn.

To break free, the restrained creature or another creature within 5 feet of it can use their action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target is no longer restrained.

**Space Lock**  
Starting at 6th level, you can exert your Patron's control over the fabric of space, preventing creatures from teleporting away from you.

You emanate an aura in a 30-foot radius around you that blocks teleportation effects. Any creature, other than you, that tries to teleport while within this aura must succeed on a Charisma saving throw against your spell save DC or the teleportation fails and the creature remains in place.

**Learn from Past Mistakes**  
Beginning at 10th level, you have learned from the past tribulations and errors of your Patron and others who have faced the Chained-One's wrath. This wisdom grants you the ability to adapt and overcome various constraints.

First, you are now immune to the Restrained condition. The binding chains and unyielding grips of your foes can no longer impede your movement or actions.

Additionally, you can use your bonus action to gain immunity to any one condition that you or your allies have encountered within the last hour. This immunity lasts until the end of the current battle.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short rest before you can use it again.

**Domain of Chains**  
At 14th level, you can summon the full power of your Patron's domain, banishing your foes to the realm of the Chained-One.

As an action, you can target a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the target is transported to the Chained-One's personal domain - a nightmarish realm of unbreakable fetters and unyielding restraints.

While trapped in this extradimensional space, the target takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of its turns. To escape, the target must use its action to attempt another Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a successful save, the target returns to the original space it occupied, free from the Chained-One's domain.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
