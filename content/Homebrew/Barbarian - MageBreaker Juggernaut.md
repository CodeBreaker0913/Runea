**Spell's Bane**  
Starting at 3rd level, your intense focus on martial prowess has diminished your ability to cast spells. You can no longer cast spells, regardless of any effects or if you multiclass out of this class.

However, in exchange for this sacrifice, when you enter a rage, you gain advantage on all saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Inertia**  
Beginning at 6th level, your enhanced physical resilience and momentum make you a formidable force on the battlefield.

Your walking speed increases by 10 feet. This boost in mobility allows you to quickly close distances and maneuver around the battlefield.

Additionally, whenever you successfully save against a spell, if you already have resistance to the damage type of that spell, you instead gain immunity to that damage type until the start of your next turn. If you do not have resistance to the damage type, you gain resistance to it until the start of your next turn.

**MageBane**  
Starting at 14th level, your indomitable spirit and resilience allows you to shrug off even the most devastating magical attacks.

Once per long rest, if a spell would reduce you to 0 hit points, you are instead reduced to 1 hit point. Additionally, you gain temporary hit points equal to the full amount of damage the spell would have dealt.
