**Rune Initiate**  
When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill. This reflects your deep understanding and study of the arcane runes and symbols that are central to your faith.

Additionally, you gain 2 cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. These cantrips count as cleric cantrips for you, and you can cast them as such. This allows you to utilize basic magical effects that complement your rune-based abilities from the start of your divine service.

**Channel Divinity: State of Revelation**  
Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to briefly enter a state of divine revelation, allowing you to perceive and replicate the essence of spells being cast around you. 

Before the start of the next combat encounter, you must roll a d6 to determine the strength of the spell you can replicate.

The d6 roll result determines the level of spell you can recreate using this feature:

1-2: You can recreate the essence of a 1st-level spell  
3-4: You can recreate the essence of a 2nd-level spell  
5-6: You can recreate the essence of a 3rd-level spell

As a reaction when a creature casts a spell within your line of sight, you can enter the State of Revelation. During this fraction of a second, you attune to the magical energies of the spell being cast.

On your turn, you can use an action to cast the replicated spell. You don't need to have this spell prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare.

The essence of the captured spell fades after the current combat encounter ends, and you must witness a new spell being cast to recreate its essence.

**Return to Sender**  
Starting at 6th level, when you successfully capture the essence of a spell using your Channel Divinity: State of Revelation feature, you also deal 1d6 radiant damage to the creature that cast the spell.

**Grace from the Gods**  
Starting at 8th level, once per long rest, you gain a boon granted by the divine powers you serve. This boon manifests as a special item that provides you with a powerful, temporary benefit.

When you finish a long rest, you find this item has appeared before you. On your next turn, you can use an action to consume or activate the item, gaining one of the following effects:

- Healing: The item heals you for 8d4 + 8 hit points.
- Advantage: You gain advantage on your next saving throw, ability check, or attack roll.
- Maximum Damage: Your next attack roll deals maximum damage.

Once you have consumed or activated the item, its magic is expended, and the item crumbles to dust. You must complete a long rest before you can benefit from Grace from the Gods again.

**Runic Mastery**  
Beginning at 17th level, your connection to the divine runes has deepened, granting you the ability to permanently retain the essence of certain spells you capture.

Once per week, whenever you enter your State of Revelation using your Channel Divinity, you can roll a d20 after determining the level of the spell you can replicate. If the d20 roll results in a 19 or 20, you permanently learn the spell you witnessed, adding it to your cleric spell list.

This permanent spell addition does not count against the number of spells you can prepare. You can prepare and cast this spell like any other cleric spell you know.
