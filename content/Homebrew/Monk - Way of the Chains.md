**Chain Mastery**  
Starting when you choose this Monk tradition at 3rd level, you become proficient with chains.

Your familiarity and expertise with chains allows you to wield them with great skill in combat. You gain the following benefits:

- You are proficient with chains as a monk weapon.
- When you make an attack with a chain, you can use your Dexterity modifier instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls.
- You can use a chain to make both melee and ranged attacks, with a range of 10 feet.

**Retracting Chains**  
Additionally, at 3rd level, you can harness the power of your chains to pull your enemies closer to you.

As an action, you can spend 2 ki points to pull any creature you can see within 30 feet of you towards your position. The target must make a Strength saving throw against your ki save DC. On a failed save, the creature is pulled up to 30 feet towards you.

**Imbue Chains**  
At 6th level, you gain the ability to imbue your chains with elemental power, dealing devastating extra damage.

As a bonus action, you can spend 1 ki point to imbue your chains with one of the following elemental energies: fire, cold, lightning, or acid. For the next minute, any successful attacks you make with your chains deal an additional 1d6 damage of the chosen elemental type.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1), and you regain all expended uses after you finish a short or long rest.

**Veins of Chains**  
Beginning at 11th level, you can reflexively activate your chains to provide a temporary defensive boost.

As a reaction when you are hit by an attack, you can spend 1 ki point to gain a +3 bonus to your AC until the start of your next turn.

**Colosseum of Death**  
Starting at 17th level, you can transport yourself and a creature within 30 feet of you to a deadly arena of chains, where only one combatant will emerge victorious.

As an action, you can spend 5 ki points to activate this feature. When you do so, you and the target creature are instantly transported to a pocket dimension made up of swirling, interlocking chains. This arena has the following effects:

- Neither you nor the target can leave the Colosseum of Death until one of you is defeated.
- You have advantage on all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks against the target creature.
- You gain a +1 bonus to your AC.
- The extra damage from your Imbue Chains feature increases to 1d6.
- The target creature cannot gain advantage on rolls against you.
