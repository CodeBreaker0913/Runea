**Tool Proficiency**  
When you adopt this specialization at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.

**Engraver Spells**  
Starting at 3rd level, you always have certain spells prepared after you reach particular levels in this class, as shown in the Engraver Spells table. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don't count against the number of artificer spells you prepare.

| Artificer Level | Spells                               |     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | --- |
| 3rd             | Detect Magic, Identify               |     |
| 5th             | Arcane Lock, Magic Weapon            |     |
| 9th             | Glyph of Warding, Intellect Fortress |     |
| 13th            | Stoneshape, Fabricate                |     |

**Engraving**  
Beginning at 3rd level, you can engrave magical runes onto items, imbuing them with powerful effects. You know 2 runes from the Rune Engraving table, and you learn additional runes as you gain levels in this class.

Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the runes you know with a different rune from the Rune Engraving table.

To engrave a rune, you must spend 1 hour carefully carving the rune into the surface of a nonmagical, unattended item. The item must be made of wood, metal, stone, or another durable material. Once a rune is engraved, the item can only have one rune on it at a time.

You can use this Engraving feature a number of times equal to your class level, and you regain all expended uses after you finish a long rest.

The effects of an engraved rune last until the item is destroyed or the rune is deliberately removed, which takes 1 hour of work. A creature attempting to remove the rune must succeed on a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check against your spell save DC.

**Engraving Savant**  
Starting at 5th level, you have become a true master of rune engraving. You can now engrave up to 2 runes onto a single item.

**Chaotic Runes**  
Starting at 9th level, you have learned to harness the volatile energies of your engraved runes in a dramatic fashion. As an action, you can cause an item with one or more engraved runes to violently explode, dealing force damage and destroying the object.

When you use this feature, choose an item you have engraved with one or more runes. The item explodes, dealing 1d6 force damage per rune engraved on it to all creatures within 10 feet of the item. This instantly destroys the item and removes all engraved runes.

Creatures can attempt a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC to take half damage from the explosion.

**Rune Stores**  
Starting at 15th level, your mastery of rune engraving has reached new heights. You can now use your Spell-Storing Item feature to store spells cast by other creatures, in addition to your own spells.

Furthermore, you can now store spells in any object, as long as it has at least one of your engraved runes on it. The object does not need to be a specially crafted Spell-Storing Item.
