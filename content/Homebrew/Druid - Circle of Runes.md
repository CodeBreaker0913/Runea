**Connection to Magic**  
When you choose this Druid Circle at 2nd level, you gain a deeper connection to the arcane energies of the world, allowing you to learn a few spells from the Wizard spell list.

You can learn up to 2 cantrips from the Wizard spell list. These cantrips count as Druid spells for you, but they don't count against the number of Druid spells you have prepared.

**Bleed into Magic**  
Starting at 2nd level, you can draw upon your own life force to power your Druidic magic, forgoing the use of spell slots.

When you want to cast a Druid spell, you can choose to sacrifice a number of hit points equal to 5 times the spell's level, rather than expending a spell slot. This allows you to cast the spell without using a prepared spell.

For example, if you want to cast a 3rd-level Druid spell, you can choose to take 15 (5 x 3) points of damage instead of using a 3rd-level spell slot.

**Runic Shape**  
Beginning at 6th level, when you use your Wild Shape feature, you can imbue yourself with the power of ancient runes instead of transforming into a beast. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits to apply:

**Rune of Protection:** You gain immunity to a damage type of your choice for the duration of your Wild Shape.

**Rune of Power:** As a bonus action, after you hit a creature with a melee or ranged attack, you can deal an additional 1d6 damage of a type of your choice.

**Rune of the Elements:** You summon a guardian elemental from the land around you, using the corresponding Elemental stat block, but with your ability scores instead of the elemental's. This guardian fights alongside you for the duration of your Wild Shape.

**Rune of Arcana:** You can cast a second spell of the same level as the one you cast on your turn. This second spell can be cast as a bonus action.

**Shape Break**  
Starting at 10th level, you can end your Runic Shape early to unleash a powerful burst of rune-infused energy.

As a bonus action, you can choose to immediately end your Runic Shape transformation. When you do so, you deal 1d8 force damage to each creature within 30 feet of you.

**Commune with Runes**  
At 14th level, your connection to the ancient power of the runes has grown so deep that you can seamlessly integrate their magic into your Wild Shape transformations.

When you use your Wild Shape feature, you can choose to either transform into a creature of your choice as normal, or you can transform into the corresponding elemental spirit instead of just summoning it.

Additionally, when you Wild Shape, you automatically gain all the benefits of your Runic Shape feature, without needing to choose a specific rune-infused option. The runes imbue your transformation, granting you the full array of protective, offensive, and supportive capabilities.
