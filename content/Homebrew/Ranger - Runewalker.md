**Runewalker Magic**  
Starting at 3rd level, your connection to the divine runes grants you access to a specialized list of spells, as shown in the Runewalker Spells table. These spells are added to your class spell list, but they don't count against the number of spells you can prepare.

These spells are considered ranger spells for you, and you can prepare and cast them as such. They provide a unique selection of magic that complements your rune-based abilities, representing your growing mastery of the arcane energies you channel through your divine connection.

| Ranger Level | Spells                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| 3rd          | Protection from Evil and Good |
| 5th          | Misty Step                    |
| 9th          | Haste                         |
| 13th         | Banishment                    |
| 17th         | Teleportation Circle          |

**Runewalk**
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to quickly teleport to a location you have designated with a divine rune.

As a bonus action, you can teleport to the location of a rune you have previously placed on the ground. You can have a number of runes placed at one time equal to your proficiency bonus.

Once you have teleported to a rune, that rune is consumed and disappears. You can only use this teleportation ability once per short rest or long rest.

**One Final Save**  
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to teleport directly to the side of an ally in need, regardless of distance.

Once per long rest, as a bonus action, you can teleport to the location of any creature you can see and that is within range of your Ranger spells. This allows you to instantly reach an ally who is in danger or requires your aid.

After you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you complete a long rest.

**One Mile Step**  
Beginning at 7th level, your mastery of teleportation magic allows you to cast the Misty Step spell without expending a spell slot.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**Rune Strike**  
Starting at 11th level, you can detonate the runes you have placed on the ground, unleashing their stored magical energy.

As a bonus action, you can choose one of your placed runes and cause it to explode, dealing 1d8 force damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the rune. You can only use this feature on a rune that you have placed yourself.

After using Rune Strike, the consumed rune disappears, and you cannot teleport to that location using your Runewalk feature.

**Slip Out Back**  
Beginning at 15th level, you gain the ability to quickly disengage from combat and teleport to safety.

As a bonus action, you can take the Disengage action. In addition, when you use the Disengage action, you can immediately teleport a distance up to twice your remaining movement speed. This allows you to quickly evade threats and reposition yourself.

Furthermore, for the remainder of your turn after using this feature, you gain resistance to a single damage type of your choice.
