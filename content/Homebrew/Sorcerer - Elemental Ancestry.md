**Elemental Ancestor**  
At 1st level, you choose one type of elemental - air, earth, fire, or water - as the source of your sorcerous power. This elemental being is your ancestral progenitor, imbuing you with a deep connection to the primal forces of the natural world.

Choose one of the following elemental types:

- Air: Your ancestor is a sylph or djinni, granting you an affinity for lightning and thunder damage.
- Earth: Your ancestor is a gargoyle or dao, granting you an affinity for acid and bludgeoning damage.
- Fire: Your ancestor is a salamander or efreeti, granting you an affinity for fire damage.
- Water: Your ancestor is a nereid or marid, granting you an affinity for cold and bludgeoning damage.

Regardless of which elemental you choose, you gain the following benefits:

- You can speak, read, and write Primordial, the ancient language of the elemental planes.
- Whenever you make a Charisma check to interact with elementals, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.

**Elemental Aspect**  
Starting at 1st level, your connection to your Elemental Ancestor grants you enhanced resistance and the ability to infuse your attacks with elemental power.

First, you gain resistance to the damage type associated with your chosen Elemental Ancestor:

- Air: Lightning and Thunder damage
- Earth: Acid and Bludgeoning damage
- Fire: Fire damage
- Water: Cold and Bludgeoning damage

Additionally, whenever you hit a creature with an attack, you can spend 1 sorcery point to deal an extra 1d4 damage of the type corresponding to your Elemental Aspect. This extra damage is added to the attack's normal damage.

**Aura of the Elements**  
Starting at 6th level, you can unleash a potent burst of elemental energy around you, damaging nearby foes and shielding yourself from the very forces you wield.

As an action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to trigger this feature. When you do so:

- Each creature within 10 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d6 damage of the type associated with your Elemental Aspect.
- You gain immunity to your Elemental Aspect damage type until the end of your next turn.

**Elemental Flight**  
At 14th level, your mastery of your Elemental Aspect grants you the ability to take to the skies.

You gain a flight speed equal to your walking speed. You can use this flight speed to hover and maneuver while in the air.

However, you cannot use this flight speed if you are wearing medium or heavy armor, as the weight and bulk interferes with your elemental-fueled levitation.

**Elemental Domain**  
Beginning at 18th level, you can expand the power and scope of your Aura of the Elements feature, creating a broader area of elemental dominance.

By spending 5 sorcery points instead of 3, you can use your action to activate your Elemental Domain, which has the following effects:

- Each enemy creature within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d6 damage of your Elemental Aspect type. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage.
- You gain immunity to your Elemental Aspect damage type for the duration of the Elemental Domain.
- All allies within 30 feet of you gain resistance to your Elemental Aspect damage type for the duration of the Elemental Domain.
