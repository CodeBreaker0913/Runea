**Runebreak**  
Starting at 3rd level, you have learned to manipulate the arcane energies of the void, allowing you to disrupt magical effects and unravel enchantments.

You have a pool of Void Points that you can expend to activate the following abilities:

**Counterspell (Reaction)**: When a creature within 30 feet of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction to expend a number of Void Points equal to the spell's level to attempt to counter it. Make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the caster's spell save DC. On a success, the spell has no effect.

**Detect Magic**: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 Void Point to detect magic in a 30-foot radius around you. For the next minute, you know the location and school of magic for any active magical effects in the area.

**Dispel Condition**: As a bonus action, you can expend 1 Void Point to touch a creature and remove one of the following conditions from them: Blinded, Deafened, Frightened, or Poisoned.

**Rune Destruction**: As an action, you can expend 3 Void Points to destroy a magic item that you are holding or that is within your reach.

You regain all expended Void Points after you finish a long rest.

| Rogue Level | Void Points |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 3rd         | 1           |
| 5th         | 3           |
| 9th         | 5           |
| 13th        | 7           |
| 17th        | 9           |

**Void Strike**  
Beginning at 9th level, your mastery of the void allows you to strike swiftly and then vanish back into the shadows.

Whenever you hit a creature with a Sneak Attack, you can expend a number of Void Points equal to the target's Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1) as a bonus action to immediately reenter a Hiding or Invisible state.

**Void-Skin**  
Starting at 13th level, your connection to the void has imbued your body with an innate resilience against magical effects.

You gain advantage on all saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

**Mage Slayer**  
When you reach 17th level, your mastery of void-touched techniques makes you a formidable foe against spellcasters.

First, you always have advantage on attack rolls against any creature that is concentrating on a spell.

Additionally, once per long rest, when you are engaged with a spellcasting creature, you can use your bonus action to enter a state of heightened focus. Your next attack roll against that spellcaster before the end of your current turn automatically deals maximum damage.
