**Tenets of the Bound**  
When you take this oath, you must choose an action or goal that you must fulfill. This could be something like "I will not lose" or "I will protect those in my care at all costs." This tenet will serve as a guiding principle that shapes your Paladin's behavior and decision-making.

**Channel Divinity: Bind the Unbound**  
Starting at 3rd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to bind unbound creatures. As an action, you can cause runic chains to spring up from the ground and bind a foe within 10 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (its choice) against your Spell Save DC, or become restrained by the chains.

While restrained, the creature repeats the saving throw at the end of its turn. On a success, it frees itself, and the chains vanish.

This Channel Divinity option allows you to temporarily restrain and impede your enemies, reinforcing your role as a guardian and controller on the battlefield.

**Channel Divinity: Break Bounds**  
Also at 3rd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to free your allies from their bounds. As a bonus action, you can remove any conditions affecting any creatures you can see within 30 feet of you.

This ability grants you the power to quickly liberate your comrades from debilitating effects, ensuring they can continue to fight unimpeded. It synergizes well with your Bind the Unbound feature, allowing you to strategically free your allies while also restraining your foes.

**Karma**  
Starting at 7th level, if the DM determines that you have fulfilled your chosen oath tenet in a significant way, you gain a "charge" of Karma. As an action, you can expend all of your gathered Karma to gain a beneficial effect determined by the DM, such as a temporary boon, a powerful divine intervention, or the ability to negate a critical failure.

This Karma mechanic represents your Paladin's dedication to their oath being rewarded with divine favor and power. It encourages you to consistently embody the principles of your tenet, as doing so can grant you impactful tactical advantages when you need them most.

**Equilibrium**  
At 15th level, if the DM feels you are not properly embodying the Tenets of the Bound, you may lose some of your accumulated Karma. However, you can then ask the DM for a general benefit, such as gaining advantage on your next roll or receiving a temporary magical item, to help you get back on track.

This feature creates a dynamic interplay between you and the DM, where your adherence to your oath is constantly evaluated. Losing Karma is a consequence for straying from your principles, but you are given the opportunity to regain your footing and continue your sacred mission.

**Chained One**  
At 20th level, you become an avatar of the bounds, granting you two powerful abilities:

1. You have resistance to all conditions.
2. Whenever you suffer a condition, another creature within 30 feet of you also suffers that condition.

However, these benefits are only active while you are free from any bounds or restraints. If you become restrained or otherwise impaired, you lose these powerful auras.
