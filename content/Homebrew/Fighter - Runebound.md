**Bare Body Combat**  
At 3rd level, you have mastered the art of unarmored combat, allowing you to harness the natural resilience of your own body as a means of defense.

While you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can still benefit from this feature if you are wielding a shield.

**Action Bound**  
Starting at 7th level, you can forge a powerful mystic bond between your actions and the runes you've bound to your body. After you complete a long rest, you can choose a specific goal or task that you wish to accomplish, and your Runebound runes will become active in service of that objective.

To activate this feature, you must state your intended goal to the DM, who will determine if it is reasonable and achievable within the context of the current situation. Once the DM accepts your goal, all of your Runebound runes become active for the duration of your attempt to complete that objective.

If you fail in your goal, the next time you take a long rest, you lose the benefits of this feature and cannot use it again for 1d4 days. Additionally, all of your Runebound runes are disabled for the same 1d4 day period.

**Rune and Bones**

**Runic Empowerment**  
At 15th level, you can harness the full fury of your Runebound runes, temporarily sacrificing your defenses to unleash devastating attacks.

As a bonus action, you can drop your Armor Class to 1 until the end of your next turn. In return, the next weapon attack you make before the end of your current turn automatically deals maximum damage.

**Time-bound**  
At 18th level, your ability to forge mystical bonds between your actions and your Runebound runes has become even more potent. You can now set time-sensitive goals when activating your Action Bound feature.

When you use your Action Bound feature, you can now include a time limit of 1d4 hours as part of your stated goal. If you succeed in completing the goal within the allotted time, you gain an additional powerful reward, in addition to having all your Runebound runes remain active.

The specific reward for completing a Time-bound goal can be one of the following, chosen by the DM:

1. **Empowered Strikes**: Your attacks are infused with extra power. For the next minute, your weapon attacks deal additional damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
2. **Evasive Maneuvers**: Your agility and reflexes are heightened. For the next minute, you gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Constitution modifier.
