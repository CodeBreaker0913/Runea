**Runea, The Land of Runes**

Runea is a world where the fundamental elements of the cosmos are indelibly etched into the very fabric of the land. Carved into cliffs, mountains, and riverbeds, the ancient runes of fire, earth, water, and air govern the ebb and flow of natural forces that shape this mystical realm.

The four primary regions of Runea each embody one of these elemental powers:

**Igan, the Land of Flames**: A harsh, volcanic landscape where the runes of fire blaze across the horizon, fueling eruptions and scorching the earth. Ash-choked skies and rivers of molten rock define this domain.

**Nedag, the Land of Land**: The rugged, mountainous heart of Runea, where the runes of earth bind the very stones and soil together. Towering peaks, deep caverns, and ancient ruins dot this domain.

**Quian, the Land of Seas**: An ocean-covered expanse where the runes of water ebb and flow with the tides, commanding the currents and shaping the vast coastlines and island chains.

**Inar, the Land of Storms**: Thundering skies, howling winds, and raging tempests characterize this domain, where the runes of air swirl and clash, unleashing the raw power of the elements.

Within these four regions, the interplay of the elements has given rise to unique sub-regions, where the runes converge in intricate patterns:

**Beach of Ash**: Where the runes of fire and earth intermingle, volcanic glass and charred sands line the coast, fed by nearby eruptions.

**Scorching Desert**: In this arid expanse, the runes of fire and air create a harsh, windswept landscape of towering dunes and shimmering mirages.

**Frozen Sea**: The runes of water and air have joined forces to craft this treacherous expanse of ice floes, glaciers, and bone-chilling blizzards.

**Bay of Salt**: In this shallow, brackish bay, the runes of water and earth have created a labyrinth of tidal pools, salt marshes, and mineral-rich mud flats.

**The Academy of Runes** - Starting Setting

At the heart of the mystical realm of Runea lies the Academy of Runes, the premier institution for the study and mastery of ancient runic magic. Situated in between all of the Regions of Runea, the academy stands as a beacon of knowledge, drawing scholars, warriors, and adventurers from across the four regions to its hallowed halls.

Founded centuries ago by the mysterious Rune Sage, the Academy of Runes is dedicated to unlocking the secrets of the elemental forces that shape Runea. Students from all walks of life - from noble scions to humble farmers - come to learn the intricate arts of runic inscription, divination, and enchantment, each seeking to harness the power of the runes for their own purposes.

The campus itself is a sprawling complex of spire-capped towers, cloistered libraries, and expansive training grounds. Massive runes etched into the very foundations of the buildings channel the flow of arcane energies, powering the academy's defenses and fueling the spellcasting of its inhabitants.

Competition to gain admittance to the Academy of Runes is fierce, with only the most talented and dedicated individuals granted the privilege of studying within its walls. Those who succeed must prove themselves worthy through rigorous coursework, and intense physical training.

Whether drawn by a thirst for knowledge, a desire for power, or a sense of duty to protect the delicate balance of the elements, all who enter the Academy of Runes find themselves irrevocably bound to the eternal cycle of the runes that define this extraordinary realm.
